        <h1>A List of All of The Hobbies I Have</h1>
        <p>I have a habit of picking up random hobbies, being obsessed with them for a time period, and then moving on to a different thing. Sometimes the time period of the hobby depends on how 'hard' the hobby is but honestly most of them last a couple of months. This is something I have been doing since I was a chiild. Now I have picked up so many that now I can essentially cycle through them.</p>
