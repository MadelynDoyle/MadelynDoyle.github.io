        <h2>About:</h2>
        <p>
            I have two cats named Kion Tuffnut Doyle and Vitani Ruffnut Doyle. They are from the same litter even though Kion is almost twice the size of Vitani.
            I got their first names from The Lion King II and The Lion Guard because The Lion King franchise is one of my favorites. Their middle names are from my favorite
            franchise How To Train Your Dragon. An interesting fact about them is that I know the exact date they were born because their mother tried to have them in my lap.
        </p>
        <p>
            Kion weighs 15lbs and Vitani weighs 9lbs. Kion is what I like to call a blonde tabby cat, and Vitani is a tricolor tabby. I usually feed them at night because when 
            they are on routine feedings, they get loud and pushy about their food, and I like to sleep in the morning. They currently eat wet food, which I had to switch them to 
            after their most recentvet appointment so Kion can lose some weight.
        </p>

            <li>When I walk into my room Kion essentially screams at me until I pick him up</li>
            <li>They don't like men(except my brother)</li>

        <h2>Additional info</h2>
        <p>Something that helps me out a lot with them is having a self cleaning litter box.
           Below are the links to the actual litter box, and the litter trays that are used as refills.</p>
