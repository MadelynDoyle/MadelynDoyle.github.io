        <h1>A List of All of The Hobbies I Have</h1>
        <p>I have a habit of picking up random hobbies, being obsessed with them for a time period, and then moving on to a different thing. Sometimes the time period of the hobby depends on how 'hard' the hobby is but honestly most of them last a couple of months. This is something I have been doing since I was a chiild. Now I have picked up so many that now I can essentially cycle through them.</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Knitting</li>
            <li>Painting My Nails</li>
            <li>Journaling</li>
            <li>Coloring</li>
            <li>Gaming</li>
            <li>Reading</li>
            <li>Drawing</li>
            <li>Photo Editing</li>
            <li>Binge Watching Shows</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Since I have been cycling through these different hobbies I want to categorize them. I have decided to put them in three categories: before college, during college, and finally both before and during. I broke them up this way because they do differ based on what part of my life I did them. Some have not carried over to college, hence that being the changepoint.</p>
