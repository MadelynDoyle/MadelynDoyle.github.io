                <h2>Dragons as an umbrella term</h2>
                <p>For the intents and purposes of this site we will be using Dragon as an umbrella term that includes: wyvern, drakes, wyrms, hydra, amphithere, and more. Dragons traditionally have 4 legs and 2 wings meaning they have 6 limbs. A good example is toothless from How to Train Your Dragon. Wyvern's have 2 back legs and 2 wings meaning 4 limbs. An example of a wyvern is Drogon from Game of Thrones. Drakes have 4 legs and no wings thus they are land dwelling, but they still have the ability to breathe fire. An example of this is Fire Drakes in Dungeons and Dragons lore. Wyrms have a long and skinny body by natyre and the amount of limbs depends on the type I collected them all into wyrms because there are lots of variations. An example of a wyrm is Haku from Spriited Away. Hydras are dragons with mutiple heads. An example of this is the Hydra Hercules defests in Anchient Greek lore. An amphithere is a wyrm with wings. An example of this type is found in Latin American culture.</p>
                <p>I have been obsessed with dragons from a young age and I have tried to learn as much as I can. Dragons range across mutiple cultures and are found in Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Indian, Greek, Norse, and Aztec Mythology. There is mention of them in the Bible in severl books including: Revelation, Psalms, Isaish, and Job. What most people think of when Dragon is mentioned was created in Europe during the Middle Ages where they were found in art.</p>
